CurlParallel
============

This is a fork, or derivate work of James Socol OOCurl and OOCurlParallel classes.
It just change some methods (adding here and there), define a Sender class and iSenderConsumer.

Plain classes, examples and PHPUnit test coming soon.

I could have brached from here https://github.com/jsocol/oocurl , but I have a different plan on the use
in pseudo parallel php pattern
